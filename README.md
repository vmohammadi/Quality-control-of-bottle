# Set up
* I note that the project size was not acceptable for Github, then I only uploaded the code.
This project was done in visual studio and using OpenCV 4.1.1

# Description
This program is an example for industrial quality control. We suppose that each bottle that passes in front of the camera, is caught in photo, then in real-time the image is processed for quality inspection to decide if the bottle is OK or Not OK.
In the program, the width of the bottles and the dimensions of the lid are checked for dimension verification and a spot on the middle of the bottle for cracks or spots.
It is noted that the bottle has been moved toward and from the camera to produce different sizes and some spots have been added manually.

Here is two examples of the OK and NOK results
